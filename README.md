# shhnowisnotthetime.github.io
Website for everything we need at school to have fun.
This is apart of the Primer Project made by me, ShhNowIsNotTheTime.

I say, tell me, tell me, tell me, where do the boys go?

This website contains the following:

1. My custom antivirus
2. My custom video editor
3. My custom HTML, CSS, JS playground^
4. My custom infinite whiteboard
5. My custom physics playground
6. My custom camera filters
7. My custom animation maker


If you have any ideas on what I should add, email me at sebbesen44@gmail.com and I will work on them and probably add them.
This is supposed to be a website and not a .html file, even though it is being made as one. 
I will never obfuscate code, or do anything malicious with the code! Feel free to download this and go thru all the code and add stuff or do what you want with it, just, if you upload it to anywhere, please credit me for the base of the project, my username is @ShhNowIsNotTheTime





^ For JS ( JavaScript) and CSS, when you click export it will put it into a HTML document, but for JS it is in <script> </script> so you can just take it out from there
