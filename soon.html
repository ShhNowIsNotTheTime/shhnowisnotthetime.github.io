    <h1>Coming Soon!</h1>
    <p>List of things that might be coming with a rating of how likely I am to make it ( out of 10)</p>
    <p>1-4/10 = its not happening unless I really feel like it or a bunch of people ask </p>
    <p>5-6/10 = If I have free time, I will probably do it</p>
    <p>7-8/10 = Its likely to happen, just might take a while</p>
    <p>9/10 = Almost definitely happening</p>
    <p>10/10 = Yup, I am going to make it and will be completed</p>
    <br>
    <p> Things in the Main:</p>

    <br> 

    <p> Things in the Gaming part:</p>

    <p> New HTML things that are their own category ( on the side):</p>
